# TriviaGame
// In this homework, I had to make a trivia game. Basically you start by clicking the "start" button and a number of questions will pop up. Then you try to answer the quetions within a time limit. After time runs out or you click "Done" then it will take you to the result page where it shows how many you got correct or not. 

//TODO: I have not finished the part for counting the correct, incorrect, and unanswered answers. 

//TODO: I have not finished the styling of the page using css. 

//TODO: I also need to make sure that you can only click one clickbox per questions.
